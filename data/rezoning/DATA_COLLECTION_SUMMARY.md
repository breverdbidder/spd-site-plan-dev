| Feature completeness | ⚠️ Partial (acreage, zoning codes) |
| Vote counts | ⚠️ 40% have vote data |
| Geographic data | ❌ Missing lat/lon |

## Next Steps to Reach 100 Records

### Option 1: Public Records Request (Recommended)
**Contact:** landdevelopmentweb@palmbayfl.gov | (321) 733-3042
**Request:** "Complete list of CPZ (rezoning) applications 2018-2025 with outcomes"
**Expected:** 50-100+ additional records
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks under Florida Sunshine Law

### Option 2: Expand to Adjacent Jurisdictions
- Melbourne, FL
- Brevard County (unincorporated)
- Cocoa, FL
- Titusville, FL

### Option 3: PrimeGov Scraper (Technical)
- Requires: Selenium/Playwright with CSRF handling
- Apify Super Scraper possible but costly
- NovusAgenda has sequential MeetingIDs (341 = Jan 2024)

## Files Deployed

| File | Location | Records |
