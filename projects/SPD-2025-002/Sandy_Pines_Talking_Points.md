# SANDY PINES PRE-APP TALKING POINTS
## 2165 Sandy Pines Dr NE, Palm Bay | December 16, 2025

## OPENING (2 min)

"Thank you for meeting with us. We own the property at 2165 Sandy Pines Dr NE and want to discuss development options given the wellhead protection easement on the parcel."

**State your understanding:**
- "We understand from Tim Roberts that the 200-foot easement is for wellhead protection"
- "We understand it cannot be vacated until the well is abandoned (~10 years)"
- "We're here to understand what we CAN do, not to fight the constraint"

---

## KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK (Write down answers!)

### 1. EASEMENT PERMITTED USES
"What activities ARE permitted within the 200-foot protection zone?"

**Specifically ask about:**
- [ ] Parking (standard asphalt)?
- [ ] Parking (pervious pavement)?
- [ ] Surface stormwater retention?
- [ ] Landscaping?
- [ ] Pedestrian sidewalks?

**If NO to parking:** "Is there any surface improvement that would be acceptable?"

### 2. CURRENT ZONING
"What is the current zoning on this parcel?"

- [ ] RM-10 or RM-15?
- [ ] Was it included in the October 2024 citywide rezoning?
- [ ] If RM-10, what is appetite for RM-15 or RM-20 rezoning?

### 3. DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
"Would the city consider a Development Agreement that guarantees our right to expand when the well is eventually abandoned?"

**If hesitant:** "We want to develop now and preserve future upside. What mechanism would the city suggest?"

### 4. TIMELINE DOCUMENTATION
"Is the ~10 year timeline for well abandonment documented anywhere? Capital Improvement Plan?"

**Ask:** "Can we get something in writing referencing the timeline?"

### 5. PHASED SITE PLAN
"Would the city accept a phased site plan showing:"
- Phase 1: Building now on buildable area
- Phase 2: Expansion when easement vacated

**Ask:** "What would that application process look like?"

## IF THEY SAY NO TO EVERYTHING

**Pivot to:**
"Given the constraints, what is the maximum we could build under current zoning on the buildable portion?"

- How many units?
- What building type?
- What is the approval timeline?

**Get specifics:**
- [ ] Max units achievable
- [ ] Required setbacks from easement line
- [ ] Any special conditions
